# 3dCamAlign
3d printer nozzle alignment camera

so this is my design for a cheap alignment camera for nozzle offset alignment on multi-extruder machines.

it's designed for this (https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005004624403224.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.20.21efcaa4ofAzrT&gatewayAdapt=glo2bra the 42deg version) and this led ring (https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005004624403224.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.20.21efcaa4ofAzrT&gatewayAdapt=glo2bra the 16 LED version)

the camera is compatible with the Ember Prototypes software/web app (https://www.emberprototypes.com/products/cxc)
